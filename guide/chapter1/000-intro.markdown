This guide is targeted towards iOS 6 and I currently do not have access (and somewhat, time) to any iOS 7 re-writes. I will be a very happy man if you, anyone who follows this guide, will contribute to this guide. You can find some ways to contribute on the [Contact & contribute](Contact-&-contribute.html) page. Thanks! Here are some information (I've not read it yet) regarding some differences when going from iOS 6 to iOS 7. [http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Updating_extensions_for_iOS_7](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Updating_extensions_for_iOS_7)

This guide is also targed towards "beginners" and more detailed/techincal information you will find on the [iphonedevwiki](http://iphonedevwiki.net/).

#### What this guide IS and what it IS NOT

This is a guide written from my perspective. I am writing this as a way to kick-start you into development. It is HIGHLY recommended that you continue to read more material such as the dev-wiki, the intermediate/advanced sections and so on. You should most definitely read the [best practices](http://www.google.se/) also.

#### Who is this for

It is for someone who is (ideally) comfortable with programming, interested in jailbroken programming but are having trouble finding concrete advice on how to start. 

If you already have experience with jailbroken development, chances are you already know everything in this guide. You might find something of value in the advanced section though.

Good luck..
