To aid in getting started I have, while writing this guide, made recordings of (almost) every step of the way. The video series shows the whole process from scratch. From setting up a fresh macbook with the development environment to coding a tweak and finally to submit it to a repo.

[Setting up the development environment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XyoTtfCiMY) - Some parts are skippable, I am spending quite some time trying to install apt/ldid which may not be needed.  
[Creating the tweak - part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7-k8BJ5xvw) - This shows the initial stages of a simple tweak, the very bare basics.  
[Creating the tweak - part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXWaz2Je0HY) - This video shows how to add settings, look at output and such things.
