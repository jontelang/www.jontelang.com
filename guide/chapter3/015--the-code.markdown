Time to write some actual code.

Open `Tweak.xm` and remove all pre-written text. We will be working the class from the "The research" chapter called `SBALockScreenView` and its method `-(void)setCustomSlideToUnlockText:(id)arg1`. 
In your `Tweak.xm` write the following.

{% highlight objective-c %}
%hook SBLockScreenView
-(void)setCustomSlideToUnlockText:(id)arg1
{
	arg1 = @"SliderChanger";
	%orig(arg1);
}
%end
{% endhighlight %}

This is pretty straight forward. You are "hooking" into the class `SBLockScreenView` and hijacking the method `setCustomSlideToUnlockText`. The argument `arg1` may say `id` but in reality it is an `NSString`. So we reset the argument to `@"SliderChanger"` and then we call the original method with the updated argument. We do this by calling `%orig(arg1)`.

We then close the `%hook` with `%end`.

Now go to the terminal again and write `make package install` to install the new tweak to your device. By now it should have changed the "slide to unlock" to "SliderChanger".

Congratulations, you are now an iOS tweak developer.
